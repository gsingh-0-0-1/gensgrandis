Welcome to Gens Grandis!

Gens Grandis is a browser-based, sandbox-style and strategy-oriented game. You can see the game at http://gensgrandis.com.

Because the game is browser-based, there is no pressure on you, the user, to download or configure any software. It also makes the game entirely free-to-play.

I've also made the game effectively open-source - you all can see all the code behind the game, and help improve it if you like. You can join our subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GensGrandis/

One note - the multiplayer functionality is extremely experimental right now. There's a lot to juggle as of now, given that I have a ton of development targets I'm trying to work towards. Multiplayer is unfortunately going to take the backburner for the time being (until I get around to implementing combat... that should be fun.)

Currently working on:
- Saving singleplayer games in browser, so that you can come back to them even after closing your tab

Some updates coming in the future:
- Multiplayer consensus algorithm so that game integrity is preserved by the server itself, and not reliant on user-created mods
- More support for modding (support exists, but it's not fully ironed out yet.)

That's all for now - thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the game!
