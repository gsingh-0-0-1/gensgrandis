Welcome to Gens Grandis!

Gens Grandis is a browser-based, sandbox-style and strategy-oriented game. You can see the game at http://gensgrandis.onrender.com.

Because the game is browser-based, there is no pressure on you, the user, to download or configure any software. It also makes the game entirely free-to-play.

I've also made the game effectively open-source - you all can see all the code behind the game, and help improve it if you like. You can join our subreddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/GensGrandis/

Multiplayer is currently disabled after Raiders were implemented.

Currently working on:
- Combat / multiplayer update: a more visible fog of war, combat between units, and labels for who units belong to in multiplayer games

Some updates coming in the future:
- Multiplayer consensus algorithm so that game integrity is preserved by the server itself, and not reliant on user-created mods
- More support for modding (support exists, but it's not fully ironed out yet.)

I haven't included an open-source license in this repository - I do want to keep the source for the game "open", but I'd rather not have a situation where someone takes this code and props it up on their own web server. But please, feel free to (and I encourage you to) fork, download, and play around with the code. If you feel like you've made a modification you want to see in the game, go ahead and submit a pull request! I'm more than happy to take a look and integrate your modifications into the game - and that works towards the eventual goal of having this game collaboratively developed.

That's all for now - thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the game!
